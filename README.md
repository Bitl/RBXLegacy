## RBXLegacy

## CREATOR'S NOTE

NOTE: This is only the source code. Click the link below to download the latest version of the client.

4-5 days didn't go to waste, didn't it?

Made this little thing to mess around with Lua and RBXPri stuff. Instructions and legal info are in the README.txt in the client itself.

Download the actual client at http://gamejolt.com/games/rbxlegacy/195327

Have fun!
